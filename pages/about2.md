> Startups are hard. 
Deeptech startups? Even harder. 

It’s not enough to have a great idea—you also need funding, technical expertise, a clear go-to-market strategy, and ideally, a few people who’ve done this before and can warn you about the inevitable landmines. That’s where we come in.  

> At Nippotica, we don’t just fund deeptech startups—we build them. 

We operate as a company builder, which is a fancy way of saying we work side-by-side, shoulder-to-shoulder, hand-in-hand with founders to turn promising science into real, scalable businesses. We provide capital, but more importantly, we provide the kind of strategic support that keeps you from making expensive mistakes.  

> We’ve seen what happens when great technology meets bad execution.

And we don’t want that to happen to you. Through our partnerships with research institutions, industry veterans, and people who actually understand the brutal realities of deeptech, we help founders avoid the usual pitfalls. 

> The goal isn’t just to launch a company—it’s to build one that lasts.

# **Nippotica: Turning Deeptech into Reality**  

## **Mission**  
Startups need more than money. They need strategy, execution, and global reach. That’s where we come in. Nippotica doesn’t just fund deeptech founders—we help them commercialize AI-driven innovations, secure technology licenses, and scale internationally.  

With expertise in AI, fintech, semiconductors, and wireless, we turn cutting-edge research into real businesses. Our ecosystem ensures that deeptech startups don’t just survive. They lead.  

## **Vision**  
Japan has world-class talent and ideas. The challenge? Turning all that innovation into real global impact.  

We build that bridge. Nippotica helps Japan’s deeptech founders compete—and win—on the world stage. Through AI commercialization, strategic partnerships, and global expansion, we drive high-value job creation and economic growth.  

## **Global Reach**  
Deeptech isn’t local. The best ideas emerge when founders, investors, and industry leaders collaborate across borders.  

With connections in Japan, the U.S., Europe, and Asia, we link startups to AI research labs, corporate partners, and university tech transfer programs. Need funding? A strategic partner? A way into new markets? That’s what we do.  

## **Startup Support**  
Ideas don’t build companies—execution does. We provide capital, mentorship, and the know-how to scale.  

From investment readiness to AI-powered defect detection and computational vision, we help founders bring breakthrough tech to market. Our expertise in M&A ensures startups move from early traction to successful exits.  

Beyond funding, we shape leaders. Founders work with seasoned entrepreneurs and industry veterans who have built and exited deeptech companies. We also facilitate licensing deals, research collaborations, and corporate partnerships.  

## **Why Nippotica?**  
We’re not an incubator. We’re a team of deeptech veterans with a track record in AI commercialization, semiconductor innovation, and international expansion.  

With networks spanning Japan, the U.S., Switzerland, the UAE, and Singapore, we help startups establish a global presence from day one. Our partnerships with AI pioneers, chip manufacturers, and fintech disruptors open doors that traditional accelerators can’t.  

We’re not just writing checks. We’re here to help deeptech founders go big—globally.
