> Nippotica is not your typical deeptech developer 

 

{% include framework/shortcodes/figure.html src="/assets/images/gen/content/nippoteam.jpeg" title="Nippotica Founders" caption="<strong>Clockwise:</strong> Daijiro Nishi (CEO), Tsuyoshi Hatao (CMO), Larry Richards Ando (CMO), and Kambiz Homayounfar (CSO)" %}

Most deeptech firms fall into one of two camps: those led by business executives who can navigate markets but struggle with the technical depth required for cutting-edge innovation, or those run by engineers and researchers who develop brilliant technologies but lack the experience to scale a business. Nippotica doesn’t have that problem. This team has built, scaled, and exited companies across finance, AI, wireless communications, and semiconductors. They know how to turn deeptech into commercial success. 

[**Daijiro Nishi**]({{ site.baseurl }}/nipponishi/) brings decades of experience in financial markets, where he helped modernize Japan’s institutional finance. But his expertise isn’t limited to banking—he understands the mechanics of scaling businesses that require both precision and adaptability. 

[**Tsuyoshi Hatao**]({{ site.baseurl }}/nippohatao/) complements this with a deep understanding of risk, analytics, and AI-driven decision-making. His ability to apply complex computational models to real-world problems extends beyond finance, making him a key force in bridging analytics and industrial applications.  

On the technology side, [**Larry Richards Ando**]({{ site.baseurl }}/nippolarry/) is an engineer and a polymath with an unconventional background. Originally trained in music, he pivoted to wireless networks, AI-powered trading, and industrial automation. His expertise in orchestrating global development teams makes him particularly adept at scaling deeptech ventures, whether it’s fintech, industrial AI, or wireless networks.  

Then there’s [**Kambiz Homayounfar**]({{ site.baseurl }}/nippokambiz/), a seasoned entrepreneur who has built companies in telecom, media streaming, semiconductors, and AI. He has firsthand experience commercializing deeptech across multiple industries and continents, with a track record of turning cutting-edge innovations into companies that get acquired.
